    <ol>
        <li>To freeze an unbaked lasagna: Line the pan with foil
             before assembling, then assemble the lasagna as directly.
              Let cool completely, and then freeze until solid. Once frozen, lift the frozen lasagna block from the casserole dish, wrap it in more foil, then freeze for up to a month.</li>
